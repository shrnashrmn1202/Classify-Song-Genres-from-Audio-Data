# Classify-Song-Genres-from-Audio-Data
Using a dataset comprised of songs of two music genres (Hip-Hop and Rock) to train a classifier and distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify). 

First, make use of pandas and seaborn packages in Python for subsetting the data, aggregating information, and creating plots when exploring the data for obvious trends or factors to be aware of when doing machine learning.  

Next, use the scikit-learn package to predict whether system can correctly classify a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc. 

Implementations of common algorithms such as PCA, logistic regression, decision trees, and so forth will be performed in this project.
